**Personal Website/ Portfolio**

This is a simple website as I use as a resume and portfolio. It's hosted on GitHub pages. \
There are several links which visitors of the website can click on:\
	&nbsp;&nbsp;*my CV - this is a link to Google Drive where my updated CV is saved\
	&nbsp;&nbsp;*project links:\
	&nbsp;&nbsp;*FinLearn links - a link to our group pitch presentation in Googled Drive, and a link to the Figma prototype\
	&nbsp;&nbsp;*ChoreDoor - the code is saved in a repo in my GitHub that is deployed through GitHub pages\
	&nbsp;&nbsp;*Music Con - - the code is saved in a repo in my GitHub that is deployed through GitHub pages\
